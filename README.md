What was done:
- Simple standalone client without framework dependencies.
- Clean methods for cities, warehouses, counterparties, and waybills.
- Unified response format for success and errors.
- Minimal business logic, focused on correct API interaction.
- Example calls in the code (create waybill, check status, print PDF).
